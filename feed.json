The redacted footage is then sent back to the cloud for the gruntier processing work of detecting and classifying the defect types. In this way it’s possible to leverage the huge processing power in the cloud whilst ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the truck.</p><p>It’s a really inspiring example of a council embracing new technology to reduce costs and improve services for their community.</p>\n",

It is now clear that basic image understanding can be reduced to a fuzzy pattern matching exercise and that’s where our current ML is at. And modern ML is a massive step up from where CV was only a decade ago.</p><p>Two, the reams of video data we are producing provide both the incentive and the means to solve the problem. CV can add value to video data produced in industries such as security, manufacturing and medicine by processing it quickly and efficiently, much cheaper than people can.

Understand that all those fiddly little decisions you need to make day-to-day add up to significant impact on the customer, the team and ultimately the company.</p><p>If you hit a bug while looking for some other issue, figure out what’s going on and fix it! If adding a small new feature would make the code unwieldy, restructure. Make sure columns in tables sort correctly - not “technically correct” - but “as the customer would expect”. Think through those frustrating corner cases and deal with them, Expect things to fail and handle errors appropriately!</p><p>Day to day micro-decisions from engineers have a massive impact on customer experience, product quality, code quality, and ultimately on the company bottom-line.</p>\n",

Well I’ll let you in on a secret - you need to stop looking for unicorns…<br><br>Software languages, tools and systems move so fast that if an engineer isn’t continually learning, they’re falling behind. But great engineers aren’t just trying to keep up - they’re driven to experiment and learn. They’re always looking for ways to make their projects more efficient - whether that’s by tweaking their working environment, automating mundane tasks or learning whole new languages.<br><br>An engineer with three languages and two web frameworks under their belt is going to have no problem getting up to speed on some missing experience if they’re sufficiently motivated.<br><br>Look for evidence of passion, learning and experimentation and use this to help your hiring decisions.<br><br>🦄 🌈&nbsp;</p>\n",

And it certainly had its advantages - no commute, less interruptions, more flexibility to exercise &amp; spend family time. Many tech folk rejoiced and declared that this was the way we should all work, all the time.</p><p>But work-at-home is no panacea. Many people simply don’t have the space / separation to do long term focussed work at home. Many have kids, family and house-mates around. Internet access varies wildly across cities and suburbs. Bad ergonomics can have a massive impact on people’s health when they are subjected to them full time.</p><p>It is also considerably harder to collaborate effectively remotely. Even with instant messaging, teleconferencing, virtual whiteboards etc, the ease of collaboration that can be obtained standing around a whiteboard in a meeting cannot be matched.</p><p>I’m about to take my business out of the small space I have carved out at home and full time into a co-working space. I’m looking forward to the change of scene, the separation from family, the tea room, and yes, even talking to other occupants of the space!</p><p>Even the short commute is appealing - a little bookend to the working day.&nbsp;</p><p>Long term, I’d love to see companies experimenting with hybrid office/remote working setup. Where “remote” could mean home / paid co-work / or a satellite office. This could be a killer combination that balances flexibility &amp; lifestyle with employee health and in-person collaboration which is so important.</p><p>Also published on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-future-work-daniel-moore-/\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n",
