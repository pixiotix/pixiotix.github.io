            "content_html": "<p>How do you deliver <em>quality</em> software products? Lots of automated testing? Go all in with TDD? Build a comprehensive manual test procedure? Invest in pair programming? Wait for your customers to find problems and fight the fires as they pop up?</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs easy to focus on a particular testing technique and assume quality delivery. Find bugs, fix bugs, ship software.</p>\n<p>But quality is about much more than that. Quality software comes from teams who care about quality as much as it comes from processes that seek to assure quality.</p>\n<p>Quality isn‚Äôt just about lack of bugs. It‚Äôs about how your system makes your customers feel - stability, security, consistency, usability, availability, design are all key parts of that experience.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs important to consider all quality across the whole system on a spectrum - which aspects of quality are non-negotiable in your product? Which are important enough to hold a release? Which can be released, but need to be fixed later? What types of issues do you just not care about?</p>\n<p>Define quality requirements and processes based on the overall priorities.</p>\n<p>Decide what quality means for your product, customers and team and have a plan to deliver.</p>\n",

Well I‚Äôll let you in on a secret - you need to stop looking for unicorns‚Ä¶<br><br>Software languages, tools and systems move so fast that if an engineer isn‚Äôt continually learning, they‚Äôre falling behind. But great engineers aren‚Äôt just trying to keep up - they‚Äôre driven to experiment and learn. They‚Äôre always looking for ways to make their projects more efficient - whether that‚Äôs by tweaking their working environment, automating mundane tasks or learning whole new languages.<br><br>An engineer with three languages and two web frameworks under their belt is going to have no problem getting up to speed on some missing experience if they‚Äôre sufficiently motivated.<br><br>Look for evidence of passion, learning and experimentation and use this to help your hiring decisions.<br><br>ü¶Ñ üåà&nbsp;</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>When I, along with so many other professionals suddenly started working from home last year, I thought it would be awesome. And it certainly had its advantages - no commute, less interruptions, more flexibility to exercise &amp; spend family time. Many tech folk rejoiced and declared that this was the way we should all work, all the time.</p><p>But work-at-home is no panacea. Many people simply don‚Äôt have the space / separation to do long term focussed work at home. Many have kids, family and house-mates around. Internet access varies wildly across cities and suburbs. Bad ergonomics can have a massive impact on people‚Äôs health when they are subjected to them full time.</p><p>It is also considerably harder to collaborate effectively remotely. Even with instant messaging, teleconferencing, virtual whiteboards etc, the ease of collaboration that can be obtained standing around a whiteboard in a meeting cannot be matched.</p><p>I‚Äôm about to take my business out of the small space I have carved out at home and full time into a co-working space. I‚Äôm looking forward to the change of scene, the separation from family, the tea room, and yes, even talking to other occupants of the space!</p><p>Even the short commute is appealing - a little bookend to the working day.&nbsp;</p><p>Long term, I‚Äôd love to see companies experimenting with hybrid office/remote working setup. Where ‚Äúremote‚Äù could mean home / paid co-work / or a satellite office. This could be a killer combination that balances flexibility &amp; lifestyle with employee health and in-person collaboration which is so important.</p><p>Also published on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-future-work-daniel-moore-/\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n",
