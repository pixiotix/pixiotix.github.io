        <p>Upon leaving University, I joined <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/csiro/">CSIRO</a> and was thrown straight in the deep-end as the solo developer of the system software for the RoadCrack road-survey vehicle.</p><p>The prototype vehicle was capable of imaging the road, processing and classifying cracks down to 1 mm resolution at 105 kmph.</p><p>The software interfaced with custom FPGA based image acquisition hardware, distributing the image data from industrial line-scan cameras via high speed frame grabbers and a network of 5+ Digital Alpha computers which performed the processing. Data was reported to a front-end control user interface in real-time.</p><p>Image processing code developed elsewhere in CSIRO extracted cracking and classified each image. Development predated contemporary machine learning algorithms and relied on classical computer vision techniques.</p><p>The opportunity to work on the RoadCrack project and the support of the crew at CSIRO was instrumental in kicking off my ongoing career in innovative, R&amp;D driven companies.</p><p>More details on RoadCrack at https://csiropedia.csiro.au/roadcrack-1999/ and check out a promo video at https://csiropedia.csiro.au/automated-pavement-crack-detection-and-classification-1994/</p>

        <p>I tuned in for a particularly interesting presentation as part of Smart Cities Summit 2021 yesterday. Some amazing work being done by Moreton Bay Regional Council and Retina Visions on automated visual asset inspection. They are leveraging their existing garbage collection vehicles to acquire video footage of the road and roadside during their rounds, and processing that video to identify all kinds of maintenance issues.</p><p>From road defects including cracking to curbside rubbish to overhanging trees - all detected automatically and fed directly into the council asset management system and used to dispatch maintenance crews.</p><p>I also noted a great use of edge AI - to mitigate privacy issues, both faces and license plates are detected on the acquisition device and blurred as the footage is acquired. The redacted footage is then sent back to the cloud for the gruntier processing work of detecting and classifying the defect types. In this way it’s possible to leverage the huge processing power in the cloud whilst ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the truck.</p><p>It’s a really inspiring example of a council embracing new technology to reduce costs and improve services for their community.</p>

        <p>Computer Vision - teaching computers to understand images - is a classically hard problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Why? Because computers don’t see images at all - just numbers where humans have had millions of years to become great at seeing.</p><p>So why are modern Machine Learning techniques such a big deal for CV? It is now clear that basic image understanding can be reduced to a fuzzy pattern matching exercise and that’s where our current ML is at. And modern ML is a massive step up from where CV was only a decade ago.</p><p>Two, the reams of video data we are producing provide both the incentive and the means to solve the problem. CV can add value to video data produced in industries such as security, manufacturing and medicine by processing it quickly and efficiently, much cheaper than people can. The same data can be used to train the ML models to process it.</p><p>The killer app for ML for CV? Edge processing of video. Managing privacy concerns inherent with video recordings, and bandwidth issues to stream video to the cloud from remote sites both mean that processing video at the edge, before sending results to the cloud is a massive win.</p><p>My prediction: it’s only going to get bigger.</p>

There’s a myriad of ways you can access / buy / build this functionality and there’s little technical risk involved in getting it working. A key question early on is: “What’s your intellectual property”?</p><p>Your IP is key because it’s what differentiates your product from others - having strong IP is key to not being overtaken by a bigger, better funded competitor.</p><p>But developing your IP will be harder, slower and carry considerably more technical risk than developing the rest of the product. Finding engineers who can build what you need will be harder too.&nbsp;</p><p>Ask yourself early on what’s unique about your product? What’s the fundamental technical core to what you’re trying to do? How can you increase your understanding &amp; decrease the technical and resourcing risks so you’re not surprised down the track?</p><p>Look after your IP and your IP will look after you.</p><p>Pixiotix specialises in consulting for founders developing innovative software / hardware products with critical IP.

Expect smaller tickets…<br>Measuring features completed? Expect a drop in quality...</p><p>Pushing harder on these metrics when the going gets tough is only going to lead to developers gaming the metric, consciously or unconsciously.</p><p>The golden rule?&nbsp;</p><p>Build a team you can trust... and trust them.</p>

        <p>Software developers, your job *isn’t* to make your work easy. Software development involves a lot of tradeoffs, and if your thought process is “what’s the easiest way to solve this problem?”, you’re not going about it the right way.</p><p>Think longer term, bigger picture. Understand that all those fiddly little decisions you need to make day-to-day add up to significant impact on the customer, the team and ultimately the company.</p><p>If you hit a bug while looking for some other issue, figure out what’s going on and fix it! If adding a small new feature would make the code unwieldy, restructure. Make sure columns in tables sort correctly - not “technically correct” - but “as the customer would expect”. Think through those frustrating corner cases and deal with them, Expect things to fail and handle errors appropriately!</p><p>Day to day micro-decisions from engineers have a massive impact on customer experience, product quality, code quality, and ultimately on the company bottom-line.</p>

        <p>When I’m called over to help out with a tricky problem in a complex software system, I’m typically hit with lots of detail on how the problem is manifesting. Typically my go-to response is “let’s take a step back”...</p><p>In a lot of instances, issues that manifest in a very specific way are in fact symptoms of a larger scale problem, so it’s important to put them in context. Pull back far enough, and the bigger problem should become apparent - staying micro-focussed can obscure the view.</p><p>It’s an unfortunate fact of Software Engineering that failure modes are typically the worst tested code paths, so a failure at one level will often manifest as a subsequent failure at another level. Make sure both (or all!) problems contributing are identified and fixed.</p><p>When problem solving, make sure you don’t miss the forest for the trees.</p>

        <p>Having trouble finding Software Engineers who are experts with years of experience in the exact technology you need? Well I’ll let you in on a secret - you need to stop looking for unicorns…<br><br>Software languages, tools and systems move so fast that if an engineer isn’t continually learning, they’re falling behind. But great engineers aren’t just trying to keep up - they’re driven to experiment and learn. They’re always looking for ways to make their projects more efficient - whether that’s by tweaking their working environment, automating mundane tasks or learning whole new languages.<br><br>An engineer with three languages and two web frameworks under their belt is going to have no problem getting up to speed on some missing experience if they’re sufficiently motivated.<br><br>Look for evidence of passion, learning and experimentation and use this to help your hiring decisions.<br><br>🦄 🌈&nbsp;</p>
