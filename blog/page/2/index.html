        <p>When it comes down to it, there’s a lot of commonality between SaaS products. Signup, login, user management, dashboards, integrations. There’s a myriad of ways you can access / buy / build this functionality and there’s little technical risk involved in getting it working. A key question early on is: “What’s your intellectual property”?</p><p>Your IP is key because it’s what differentiates your product from others - having strong IP is key to not being overtaken by a bigger, better funded competitor.</p><p>But developing your IP will be harder, slower and carry considerably more technical risk than developing the rest of the product. Finding engineers who can build what you need will be harder too.&nbsp;</p><p>Ask yourself early on what’s unique about your product? What’s the fundamental technical core to what you’re trying to do? How can you increase your understanding &amp; decrease the technical and resourcing risks so you’re not surprised down the track?</p><p>Look after your IP and your IP will look after you.</p><p>Pixiotix specialises in consulting for founders developing innovative software / hardware products with critical IP.

        <p>The saying “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure” applies very well to software development. If you’re trying to measure output / quality in software development using any simple measure you’re doing it wrong.</p><p>Measuring lines of code? Expect verbose code...<br>Measuring tickets closed? Expect smaller tickets…<br>Measuring features completed? Expect a drop in quality...</p><p>Pushing harder on these metrics when the going gets tough is only going to lead to developers gaming the metric, consciously or unconsciously.</p><p>The golden rule?&nbsp;</p><p>Build a team you can trust... and trust them.</p>

Think through those frustrating corner cases and deal with them, Expect things to fail and handle errors appropriately!</p><p>Day to day micro-decisions from engineers have a massive impact on customer experience, product quality, code quality, and ultimately on the company bottom-line.</p>

Well I’ll let you in on a secret - you need to stop looking for unicorns…<br><br>Software languages, tools and systems move so fast that if an engineer isn’t continually learning, they’re falling behind. But great engineers aren’t just trying to keep up - they’re driven to experiment and learn. They’re always looking for ways to make their projects more efficient - whether that’s by tweaking their working environment, automating mundane tasks or learning whole new languages.<br><br>An engineer with three languages and two web frameworks under their belt is going to have no problem getting up to speed on some missing experience if they’re sufficiently motivated.<br><br>Look for evidence of passion, learning and experimentation and use this to help your hiring decisions.<br><br>🦄 🌈&nbsp;</p>

        <p>When I, along with so many other professionals suddenly started working from home last year, I thought it would be awesome. And it certainly had its advantages - no commute, less interruptions, more flexibility to exercise &amp; spend family time. Many tech folk rejoiced and declared that this was the way we should all work, all the time.</p><p>But work-at-home is no panacea. Many people simply don’t have the space / separation to do long term focussed work at home. Many have kids, family and house-mates around. Internet access varies wildly across cities and suburbs. Bad ergonomics can have a massive impact on people’s health when they are subjected to them full time.</p><p>It is also considerably harder to collaborate effectively remotely. Even with instant messaging, teleconferencing, virtual whiteboards etc, the ease of collaboration that can be obtained standing around a whiteboard in a meeting cannot be matched.</p><p>I’m about to take my business out of the small space I have carved out at home and full time into a co-working space. I’m looking forward to the change of scene, the separation from family, the tea room, and yes, even talking to other occupants of the space!</p><p>Even the short commute is appealing - a little bookend to the working day.&nbsp;</p><p>Long term, I’d love to see companies experimenting with hybrid office/remote working setup. Where “remote” could mean home / paid co-work / or a satellite office. This could be a killer combination that balances flexibility &amp; lifestyle with employee health and in-person collaboration which is so important.</p><p>Also published on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-future-work-daniel-moore-/">LinkedIn</a></p>

        <p>Significant pieces of engineering work can benefit greatly from design review. The review process can be as simple as an informal chat between peers or follow a formal process with a proposal document and written feedback or an in-person review session.</p><p>Design review is particularly valuable when a problem is highly constrained through user requirements or technical difficulty.</p><p>Design discussions often swing wildly between a number of proposals which all seem reasonable at first glance but are discounted due to various deficiencies with respect to requirements. Ensure the team feels empowered to challenge proposals, and not threatened by having their ideas challenged.&nbsp;</p><p>As a leader, prepare for your proposals to be found wanting by the team - it can hurt but if they come up with better proposals, you’re winning.</p>

        <p>Strong collaboration requires strong communication. Building a culture of strong, open communication is critical in the success of teams.</p><p>Good communication is clear &amp; concise - it gets to the point and stays on the point.&nbsp;</p><p>Good communication is correct and consistent - it’s fine to not have all the answers, or be confident about something. Giving a solid answer may require some research and it’s likely everyone will benefit from it.</p><p>Encourage participation in discussions, and ensure contributions are heard and considered.</p>

        <p>A good code review process can greatly improve code quality while bringing significant benefits in engineering team culture.&nbsp;</p><p>At its most basic, code review helps catch errors that would otherwise have been missed by the author of a code change. Involving more senior engineers and/or those with more experience in a particular codebase or technique can catch higher level issues such as leaky abstractions, locking hierarchy or threading problems.</p><p>But just as importantly, code review can be used to encourage engineers to take responsibility for their work. Not just make something work, but think through what they’re doing, understand it, make a good change, and be prepared to defend it.</p><p>A team that can respectfully give feedback and even challenge each others work is a stronger team.</p><p></p>
